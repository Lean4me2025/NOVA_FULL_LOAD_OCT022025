Nova 8.5A — Updated Final (Light Theme, No-Audio Edition)
=========================================================

Build date: 2025-10-10

What’s included
---------------
- Light/white theme UI (no dark mode)
- Original Welcome page layout restored with the **89% fact** above the tagline
- Email + PIN capture with note: "You can invest in yourself and add your email and PIN so you can return to your results and further your journey."
- Category → Traits → Role Reveal → Reflection full flow
- Client-side welcome audio **pre-wired** to play `assets/audio/welcome_trimmed.mp3` instantly when added
- Smooth transitions; no debug/console noise
- GitHub/Vercel-ready structure

Audio (pending)
---------------
Place your audio here later (optional):
  assets/audio/welcome_trimmed.mp3   (preferred)
The player is wired to auto-play the trimmed file on page load. If not present, no error is shown.

Data
----
This app looks for these JSON files (drop yours in later with the same names/shape):
  - assets/data/traits_with_categories.json
  - assets/data/category_matrix.json
  - assets/data/ooh.json

If files are missing, the app displays a gentle placeholder and remains navigable.

Deploy
------
Upload this folder to your GitHub repo and deploy through Vercel as usual.
No build step required (plain HTML/CSS/JS).

Files to edit later (if needed)
-------------------------------
- assets/data/*.json  (your actual data files)
- assets/audio/welcome_trimmed.mp3 (your trimmed welcome audio)
