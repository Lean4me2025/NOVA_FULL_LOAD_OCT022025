Files in this bundle are small, drop-in snippets you can paste into your existing pages.

Files:
- patches/welcome_h1.snippet.html         -> add H1 at very top of the welcome page
- patches/welcome_time_text.snippet.html  -> replace the time estimate line
- patches/reflection_roles_text.snippet.html -> change wording from 'Try these roles:' to 'Discover these roles:'
- patches/invest_payhip_buttons.snippet.html -> exact Payhip embeds (script + four product buttons)

How to apply:
- Open your existing files and paste the snippet content in the indicated spot.
- Keep your current CSS/JS untouched; these are pure content updates.
