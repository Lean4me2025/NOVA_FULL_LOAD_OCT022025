Nova 8.5A Final — Audio Trim Patch
==================================

What this does
--------------
This build makes your existing welcome audio start IMMEDIATELY by trimming the leading silence
**client‑side** (in the browser) using the Web Audio API. You do NOT need to edit the audio file.
Just drop your existing welcome audio into the folder below and the script will auto‑trim and play.

Audio files (preferred order)
-----------------------
Preferred:
  assets/audio/welcome_trimmed.mp3 (your new clean version)

Fallbacks (client-side trim applied):
  assets/audio/welcome_original.mp3
  assets/audio/welcome_original.m4a

You can keep both files—MP3 is preferred for widest compatibility.

How it works
------------
- On page load, the script fetches the audio, decodes it, scans for the first non‑silent sample,
  then starts playback from that exact offset. The rest plays naturally to the end—no fade added.
- If the browser blocks autoplay, the page will show a small “Play Welcome” button for the user
  to tap once. After a single tap, it will play immediately with the trimmed start.

Integration
-----------
If you're merging this into your existing Nova 8.5 build:
- Replace your current welcome page's index.html and script.js with these versions,
  or merge the autoplay/trim logic into your files (search for "playWelcomeWithTrim").
- Ensure your audio file is named as above and placed in assets/audio/.
- Deploy to Vercel. That's it.

Notes
-----
- This is a client‑side trim; it does not modify your audio file on disk.
- If you later prefer a permanently trimmed file, you can swap in a trimmed MP3 with
  the same filename (welcome_original.mp3), and the logic will still work.
