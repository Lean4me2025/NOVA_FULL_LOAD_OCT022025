This patch guarantees the Welcome header shows on the welcome page WITHOUT touching your layout.
It auto-injects the H1 directly ABOVE the 89% line at runtime and adds minimal CSS for visibility.

Included fixes (only):
1) Welcome header injection — “Welcome to Nova” above the 89% line.
2) Time estimate copy — “This experience takes about 2–5 minutes to complete.”
3) Reflection wording — “Discover these roles:”
4) Invest buttons — exact Payhip embeds for Mastery, Pro, Starter, and Purpose Book.

No other styling or layout changed.
