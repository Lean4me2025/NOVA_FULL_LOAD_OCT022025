What changed in v9.4f (patch summary)
1) Traits layout fix — evenly distributed across the full page
   - CSS grid with responsive auto-fit columns
   - Ensures traits no longer bunch on one side

2) Traits loading guarantee
   - JS guards for missing/empty arrays
   - Resilient rendering against malformed data
   - Uses stored selected categories to filter traits

3) Invest links
   - All Payhip links set to open in a new tab (target="_blank", rel="noopener")

4) Footer tag
   - Unified footer string: “Nova v9.4f — Discover Purpose. Live It Boldly.”

How to apply
Option A — Drop-in replace (recommended)
- Copy “patches/” files into your project, keeping the same relative paths (or adjust imports accordingly).
- Ensure your pages load the updated CSS/JS (see below).

Option B — Manual diff/merge
- Open each file under “patches/” and merge the relevant sections into your codebase.

Required imports (examples)
- CSS:  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/css/style.css" />
- JS:   <script src="/assets/js/traits.js" defer></script>

Data files expected
- /data/traits_with_categories.json
- /data/category_matrix.json
- /data/ooh.json

Notes
- We did not change any other styling beyond the traits grid and footer line.
- Voice intro remains disabled by default. Add your audio later when ready.
